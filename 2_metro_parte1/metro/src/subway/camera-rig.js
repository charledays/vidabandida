/**
 * Camera rig. The camera always faces the doors from a seat across the aisle; there is no
 * orbit. Framing adapts to the aspect ratio (on a phone the doors fill the frame). Motion is
 * layered on top: a slow ride float on the clock, scaled by speed (rides are short and fast, so
 * anything keyed to track distance would flicker frame to frame), a lurch that eases after the
 * timeline's acceleration. Standing, the camera is dead still: any sub-pixel motion makes hard
 * edges (the door frames) crawl on a phone, where the image isn't antialiased.
 * The doorway: setDoor(f) walks from the seat out through the open doors onto the platform
 * (0 = seated, 1 = standing on the platform facing the wall); out there,
 * setLook(yaw) turns the head left or right along the platform (radians, 0 = facing the wall).
 * On a phone the platform is explored instead: setSpot(x) glides you sideways along it (metres
 * from the doors), and setInspect(point, f) walks you up to a spot on the art (f 0..1).
 *
 * Portrait screens get their own composition, not a shrunk desktop one: seated, the frame is
 * cut tight to the doors from a step further back (a longer, flatter lens), so there's little
 * ceiling or floor, and setSeatLook(yaw) turns the head along the car to see the rest (the
 * window, the line map, the seats; radians, + = left); on the platform you stand back behind
 * the column line, so the wall fills the frame.
